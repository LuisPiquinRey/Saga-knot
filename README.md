## 📖 Overview

**Saga-Knot** is a sophisticated, enterprise-grade **e-commerce microservices platform** built with modern distributed systems architecture patterns. The platform demonstrates advanced implementation of:

- **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** using Axon Framework
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
- **Event Sourcing** for complete audit trails
- **Saga Pattern** for distributed transaction orchestration
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** with bounded contexts
- **Polyglot Persistence** (MySQL, MongoDB, Redis)

The project serves as both a learning resource and a foundation for building scalable, resilient e-commerce systems.

### Key Architectural Patterns

- **Service-per-Database Pattern**: Each microservice owns its database
- **Event Sourcing**: All state changes captured as immutable events
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write models for optimized performance
- **Saga Pattern**: Coordinated distributed transactions with compensation logic
- **API Gateway Pattern**: Single entry point with authentication/authorization
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamic service registration with Eureka
- **Centralized Configuration**: Spring Cloud Config Server
